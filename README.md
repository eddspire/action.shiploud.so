**Stop hiding your best stories in git logs.** Every commit is a chapter in your entrepreneurial journey—BuildInPublic.so helps the world read it.

## 🎯 **Your Git History Is Your Success Story**

You're already documenting your wins, struggles, and breakthroughs in every commit message. **But that story is trapped in your repository.** 

This GitHub Action automatically transforms your commits into beautiful, shareable developer cards that build your audience while you build your product.

### ✨ **What You Get**

🏗️ **Build Your Audience While You Build**  
Every push becomes content. Every feature becomes a story. Every bug fix becomes a teaching moment.

🔒 **Zero Code Access, Maximum Trust**  
We read your commit messages, not your code. Your intellectual property stays yours—always.

⚡ **Effortless Build-in-Public**  
No more "what should I tweet about today?" Your work creates your content automatically.

📈 **Developer Portfolio That Grows Itself**  
Beautiful cards showcasing your real work, real progress, and real expertise.

## 🚀 **From Setup to Success in 60 Seconds**

### 1. **Add the Magic** ✨

Create `.github/workflows/shiploud.yml` in your repo:

```yaml
name: "ShipLoud - Automatic Story Creation"
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]

jobs:
  build-in-public:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Transform commits into stories
        uses: eddspire/action.shiploud.so@v1.0.2
        with:
          api-token: ${{ secrets.SHIPLOUD_API_TOKEN }}
```

### 2. **Connect Your Story** 🔗

1. Visit [shiploud.so/dashboard](https://shiploud.so/dashboard)
2. Connect your repository (we only need commit metadata)
3. Copy your unique API token
4. Add it as `SHIPLOUD_API_TOKEN` in your repository secrets

### 3. **Watch Your Audience Grow** 📈

Push your next commit and watch it transform into a beautiful, shareable story card automatically!

## 💡 **Before vs After**

### Your Current Reality:
❌ Great work happening in private  
❌ Struggling to create consistent content  
❌ Amazing commits buried in git logs  
❌ Building in isolation  

### With ShipLoud.so:
✅ Every commit becomes content  
✅ Automatic, authentic storytelling  
✅ Growing audience sees your real journey  
✅ Community building happens naturally  

---

## 🛡️ **Your Code, Your Castle—We Just Read the Diary**

**What We Access:**
- ✅ Commit messages (your stories)
- ✅ Author information (your credit)
- ✅ Timestamps (your journey timeline)

**What We NEVER Access:**
- ❌ Your source code
- ❌ File contents
- ❌ Repository files
- ❌ Sensitive data

**Security Promise:** Even if someone hacked our entire system, they still couldn't see your code. We literally don't have access to it.

## ⚙️ **Advanced Storytelling**

### Tell Stories from Multiple Branches
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop, feature/* ]
```

### Conditional Story Creation
```yaml
- uses: eddspire/action.shiploud.so@v1.0.2
  if: github.event_name == 'push' && !contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[skip-story]')
  with:
    api-token: ${{ secrets.SHIPLOUD_API_TOKEN }}
```

## 🔧 **When Things Don't Work**

### **Action Not Running?**
- Double-check `.github/workflows/` path
- Verify `SHIPLOUD_API_TOKEN` in repository secrets
- Ensure repository is connected in your dashboard

### **Stories Not Appearing?**
- Check action logs in your repository's Actions tab
- Confirm your shiploud.so account setup
- Verify API token is still valid
